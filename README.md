# HoleyCastle

HoleyCastle was my entry in Brackeys 2020.1 game jam, which had the "Holes" theme and a time limit of 1 week. This repository contains all of the game's assets.

## Description

The game does a twist on the classic 2D tower defense genre, by only having a single "tower", the hole, which the player can upgrade in order to protect a castle. It features a backstory and many enemy types, which spice up the gameplay.

## Playing

A WebGL build of the game is available on [itch](https://alexturculet.itch.io/holeycastle).

## Installation

If you wish to download the project and mess with it, you can clone the repository, but you will need a version of Unity released at least in 2020. You may use any of the graphical assets or code, but we did not create all of the audio files and, as such, cannot give you permission to use them.
